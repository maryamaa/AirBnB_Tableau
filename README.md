## **Project Motivation**
We created this data analysis to assist Airbnb customers in making informed choices from the vast number of listings available. With so many options to choose from, it can be overwhelming to find the perfect listing that suits your needs. Our data analysis provides a visual overview and a tool to filter based on your preferences, making your Airbnb search much easier.

## **About Data**
the [dataset](https://www.mavenanalytics.io/data-playground?page=4&pageSize=5) we used for this project was called "Airbnb Listings & Reviews" and was obtained from the Maven Analytics website. This dataset was sourced from Inside Airbnb.

## **Project Description**
Airbnb Listings Data Analysis is an interactive data analysis project designed to help users make more informed decisions when choosing an Airbnb listing. The project provides a visual overview of Airbnb listings in 10 different cities, including information about the city, neighborhood, property type, room type, price, review score rating, and listed amenities provided by the host.
To analyze and visualize the data, we used Python for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and Tableau for building an interactive dashboard that allows users to filter listings based on their needs. For data processing and preparation, we created several calculated fields, including Price in Dollar and Negative Sentiment, to help users evaluate the listings more effectively.
Our dashboard allows users to filter listings by price range, room type, and host type, making it easy to find the perfect Airbnb listing in Sydney or any of the other cities in our dataset. With its comprehensive data analysis, interactive dashboard, and unique insights into the cities and neighborhoods featured in the dataset, the Airbnb Listings Data Analysis project provides a powerful tool for anyone looking to book an Airbnb listing.

## **Analytics Approach**
The Airbnb Listings Data Analysis project involved several steps to process, analyze, and visualize the data. First, we downloaded the dataset from the Maven Analytics website and imported it into Python for exploratory data analysis (EDA). During the EDA phase, we used Python to examine the structure and quality of the data, looking for any inconsistencies, missing values, or potential outliers.
Here is a brief step-by-step description of the analytical approach we used:
Dealing with missing data
Calculated fields: We created several calculated fields to prepare the data for analysis. One example is converting the price of listings from local currency to USD.
Negative sentiment: We analyzed the "review scores" variable to evaluate which city had the lowest review scores.
Splitting data: We split the "Amenities" variable into multiple fields to enable better analysis.
Pivot data: We used Tableau's pivot feature to calculate new information based on in-field data, such as amenities and reviews.
These steps allowed us to analyze the data and create an interactive dashboard that provides useful insights to users looking for Airbnb listings.
In addition to the dashboard, we used Tableau to create several other charts and visualizations that highlight different aspects of the data. For example, we created a chart that shows the relationship between Price and Review Scores across different cities, allowing users to see which cities offer the best value for their money. We also created a chart that compares the number of listings in each city with the average review score, providing insight into how popular cities compare in terms of overall satisfaction.
Overall, our analytical approach involved a combination of Python for data processing and exploratory analysis, and Tableau for visualization and dashboard creation. By leveraging these tools and techniques, we were able to provide a comprehensive and interactive analysis of the Airbnb Listings dataset that helps users make more informed decisions when choosing an Airbnb listing.
